# Plan for Integrating Hexabot with CellCast Web Application

Based on your requirements, you want to create a multi-tenant integration where users from your CellCast Web Application can access the Hexabot admin interface to design their own chatbots using their existing CellCast authentication. Here's a plan to achieve this:

## 1. Authentication Integration Strategy

### Single Sign-On (SSO) with JWT or OAuth2

- CellCast generates a secure token (JWT) with user identity and tenant information
- When a user clicks "Design Chatbot" in the CellCast sidebar:
  - Generate a signed JWT with user info, permissions, and tenant ID
  - Redirect to Hexabot with this token in the URL or as a header
  - Hexabot validates the token and creates a session for that user

## 2. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

- Modify Hexabot's user and data models to include tenant ID (organization ID)
- Ensure all data access queries include tenant filtering
- Each chatbot created belongs to a specific tenant
- Users can only access/modify chatbots within their tenant

## 3. User Experience Flow

1. User logs into CellCast Web Application
2. User navigates to the sidebar and clicks "Design Chatbot"
3. A new tab opens with the Hexabot admin interface
4. Authentication is passed seamlessly (no need to log in again)
5. User can only see and modify chatbots belonging to their organization

## 4. Implementation Steps

### Modify Hexabot Authentication System:

- Add tenant awareness to Hexabot's authentication system
- Create an authentication endpoint that accepts and validates tokens from CellCast

### Data Model Changes:

- Add tenant/organization ID to relevant database models
- Update access control to filter by tenant

### CellCast Integration:

- Add "Design Chatbot" button in the CellCast sidebar
- Implement token generation when the button is clicked
- Configure the button to open a new tab with the appropriate URL

### User Management:

- Decide whether to sync all users or create them on-demand
- Map CellCast roles to Hexabot permissions

### Security Considerations:

- Ensure proper token signing and verification
- Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Apply rate limiting and other security measures
